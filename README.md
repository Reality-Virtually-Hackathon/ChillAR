# ChillAR
 
ChillAR is an augmented reality based application that overlays your reality with calming visuals and soundscapes. ChillAR uses the MergeVR cube as visual tracker and trigger for your calming AR experience. Start the app by rolling the MergeVR cube to dive into one of six augmented reality scenarios, each configured to sooth your mind through a different effect. Ranging from little orbs of light naturally spawning and dancing through your field of vision to a white sphere slowly growing in front of you in tandem to your heartbeat, ChillAR is supposed to work off of your natural body feedback to make each experience a personal one. Within one roll of the dice, the visuals will increase in intensity to create a natural crescendo, culminating in a white screen for a couple of seconds, until the opacity decreases and reality slowly sets in again.
